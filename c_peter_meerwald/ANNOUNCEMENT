    many more algorithms to come!
    see what is in stock: http://www.cosy.sbg.ac.at/~pmeerw/Watermarking

  and utility programs

    cmp_pgm     - compute difference image, PSNR, ...
    cmp_dct     - compute full-frame DCT domain difference image
    cmp_dct8x8  - compute 8x8 block-based DCT difference image
    cmp_dwt     - compute DWT domain difference image



Contact: Comments are welcome!

More algorithms will be added over time, I have implemented about 13
watermarking algorithms in the spatial-, DCT-, and wavelet domain so far.

Please report what problems you have, suggestions, ...
