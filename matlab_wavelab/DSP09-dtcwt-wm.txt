MATLAB code implementing and testing the blind DT-CWT domain additive 
spread-spectrum watermark detector proposed in the paper

Roland Kwitt, Peter Meerwald, Andreas Uhl, "Blind DT-CWT Domain Additive Spread-Spectrum Watermark Detection", In Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing, DSP '09, Santorin, Greece, July 5 - 7, 2009.

How to run:

  1. Compute the detection performance of the linear correlation 
     (LC), LRT-GGD and Rao-GGD detectors on a series of test images
     for JPEG or JPEG 2000 attack.

     run_attack_tests
       See the comments in the file in order to determine the number of
       experiments (e.g. 1000) to perform, select the detector type, select 
       the attack (JPEG or JPEG2000), etc.

       To reproduce the results of Figure 6 and 7, you have to run the script
       six times with, setting selectattack = {JPEG_ATTACK, J2K_ATTACK} and
       detectortype = {'lc', 'hernandez', 'rao'}.

     The output is a set of files in your temporary directory which can 
     be used to generate plots.

  2. To produce plots, simply run
			
     generate_jpeg_plots
     and
     generate_j2k_plots
       
     The plots are produced in .eps format in your temporary directory.
		
Dependencies:

The following programs and libraries need to be installed and in the 
execution path (shell or MATLAB):
* Nick Kingsbury's Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DT-CWT)
  code for MATLAB; you have to contact the author at 
  http://www-sigproc.eng.cam.ac.uk/~ngk/
* David Taubman's Kakadu JPEG 2000 codec (v6.0), http://www.kakadusoftware.com
* Minh N. Do's MATLAB implementation of the moment matching and 
  maximum likelihood estimators for the generalized Gaussian 
  density, http://www.ifp.uiuc.edu/~minhdo/software/
* Nikola Sprljan's MATLAB Quality Assessment toolbox (v1.10), 
  http://sprljan.com/nikola/matlab/qassessment.html

The code has been tested under Debian and Ubuntu Linux and MATLAB 7.4.
